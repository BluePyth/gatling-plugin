	<p>
		This plugin allows you to track a Gatling simulation in your Jenkins job :
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Setting up failure or instability conditions based on the simulation's results.</li>
		<li>Monitoring performance over time.</li>
		<li>Publication of reports</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Gatling simulation's results are stored in the ${GATLING_HOME}/results/ directory.
		For each simulation's run a folder is created according to the following pattern :
		mysimulation-20120911161003, the first part is usually the name of the simulation and the second part a
		timestamp.
		Therefore fill the field "Output directory prefix" with the first part of this directory name.</p>
